1. Hardware-wise, unsigned addition is the same as signed addition when using two's complement encoding. 
   Using evidence from the test bench, is unsigned multiplication the same as signed multiplication?
   
   When both input data are unsigned ,the results are the same;
   When one input data is unsigned other is signed,the results are not the same;

2. What is that error? How does the original code fix the compilation error?
 Error:Unbound variable `test_function'
    input data width 'n' is not defined, the original code defined data width 'n' = 8

   Why is two function definitions not necessary?
    you can find in "mkTbMulFunction" both functions use the same variable : 'n'.

3. Is your implementation of multiply_by_adding a signed multiplier or an unsigned multiplier?
    
    an signed multiplier
