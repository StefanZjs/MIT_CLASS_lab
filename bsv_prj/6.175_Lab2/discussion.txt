1. Hardware-wise, unsigned addition is the same as signed addition when using two's complement encoding. 
   Using evidence from the test bench, is unsigned multiplication the same as signed multiplication?
   
   When both input data are unsigned ,the results are the same;
   When one input data is unsigned other is signed,the results are not the same;

2. What is that error? How does the original code fix the compilation error?
 Error:Unbound variable `test_function'
    input data width 'n' is not defined, the original code defined data width 'n' = 8

   Why is two function definitions not necessary?
    you can find in "mkTbMulFunction" both functions use the same variable : 'n'.

3. Is your implementation of multiply_by_adding a signed multiplier or an unsigned multiplier?
    
    an signed multiplier

5. Now consider extending your Booth multiplier even further to a radix-8 Booth multiplier. 
    This would be like doing 3 steps of the radix-2 Booth multiplier in a single step. 
    Can all radix-8 Booth encodings be represented with only one non-zero symbol like the radix-4 Booth multiplier? 
    Do you think it would still make sense to make a radix-8 Booth multiplier?
    
    it depends on the design goal,if need to work in higher Fmax,it make sense to make a radix-8 Booth multiplier

6. How long did you take to work on this lab?
    less than 3 hours
