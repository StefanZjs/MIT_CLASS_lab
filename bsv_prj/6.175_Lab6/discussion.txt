Discussion Question 1:
If you actually set the prediction to pc, you will get errors in the assembly tests; the first one will be from cache.riscv.vmh.

What is the error you get?
    log:ERROR: Executing unsupported instruction at pc: 00004000. Exiting

What is happening in the processor to cause that to happen?
    Execute finds misprediction: PC = 0000020c
    Fetch: Mispredict, redirected by Execute

Why do not you get this error with PC+4 and BTB predictors?
    because set the prediction to pc, in 'Execute' pc will always be equal to ppc.
    so,there will always be 'mispredict'
How would you fix it?
    ppc = pc + 4
